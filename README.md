## `$ whoami`

Software Engineer building a **cloud-native B2C/B2B platform** with event-driven architecture — high-concurrency workflows, real-time geospatial processing, privacy-first by design.

By day I write Python and TypeScript. By night I study **Cyberdefense** at Universidad de la Defensa Nacional (UNDEF) — the first undergraduate degree in Argentina dedicated to Critical Infrastructure Protection.

Previously a **Programming Instructor** at [Silicon Misiones](https://siliconmisiones.gob.ar/), teaching Python for Data Science & AI to 50+ students. That experience taught me that explaining things clearly is just as valuable as building them — a skill I now apply to [my technical blog](https://zapf.dev/blog).

## `$ cat focus.md`

- 🔧 Designing reliable event-driven workflows and scalable background processing
- 🗺️ Real-time geospatial data modeling (privacy-by-design, strict data segregation)
- 🔒 Applying cybersecurity fundamentals as an engineer, not just a student
- ✍️ Bridging **computer science concepts** with **practical security applications** on [zapf.dev](https://zapf.dev)

### 🔒 Stealth-mode SaaS *(in progress)*
Cloud-native platform built from scratch — event-driven, geospatially-aware, privacy-first.  
Stack: FastAPI · Next.js · PostGIS · Celery · Redis · AWS. More details when it ships.

### 🌐 [zapf.dev](https://zapf.dev)
Personal website and technical blog. Built with **Astro 5** and **Catppuccin**, featuring an interactive D3.js knowledge graph, Pagefind full-text search, Mermaid diagrams, and a Wavesurfer.js audio player for post summaries.  
→ [live](https://zapf.dev) · [source](https://github.com/MatiasZapf/zapf.dev)

### ⚙️ [dotfiles](https://github.com/MatiasZapf/dotfiles)
Fedora 43 / COSMIC desktop, managed with GNU Stow. Catppuccin Frappé end-to-end.  
→ Alacritty · tmux · LazyVim · Starship · ble.sh + fzf

**Daily Environment**
- **OS:** Fedora 43 + COSMIC Desktop
- **Editor:** Neovim (LazyVim) — fast navigation is non-negotiable
- **Terminal:** Alacritty + tmux + Starship
- **Shell:** Bash + ble.sh + fzf — Fish-like UX, zero regrets
- **Theme:** Catppuccin Frappé, everywhere

**Quirks & Commitments**
- ⌨️ **Colemak-eD-EsAlt** user — custom XKB with Spanish alternates. Painful to learn. Worth it.
- 🧠 **Obsidian** power user — atomic notes, Dataview dashboards, QuickAdd menus, a vault I'm probably too proud of
- 🔤 **VictorMono Nerd Font** with ligatures — because monospace should still be beautiful
